Installing and configuring the JIRA plugin for Webstorm is not hard to do and gives great integration into the IDE.  
After installing you will end up with an integrated dashboard like this:

To install go to preferences and go down to plugins:

Click on Browse repositories
Then type JIRA in the search box.

Then double click on the Atlassian result.  
Now OK all the dialogs. 
In the status bar you should see the plug-in installing.
When it has finished you need to restart.

Now you will see an Atlassian button on the tool bar.  After a while (on first load it takes time) you will see the list of bugs assigned to you.
