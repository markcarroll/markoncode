I switched from Windows to a Mac a year and a half ago, but every now and them I want to do something that just seemed so much easier in Windows.  In this case, mount a Windows file share so I can access it from the command line (or script it).  Turns out it is pretty easy too if you know the special sauce.  

	$ mkdir /Volumes/sharename
	$ mount -t smbfs -o nosuid,nodev //username@servername/sharename /Volumes/sharename
